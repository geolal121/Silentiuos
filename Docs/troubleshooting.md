## Troubleshooting

- **Server not starting**: Check for missing dependencies in `requirements.txt` and ensure that the correct Python version is installed.
- **Client cannot connect**: Verify that the server is running, and ensure the correct **IP address** and **passcode** are used.
- **Encrypted message not displaying**: Ensure that the **passcode** is the same on both the sender and recipient sides.
